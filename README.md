**Rune is a fast, GPU-accelerated, full-featured IDE and terminal multiplexer, suitable both for automatic and manual programming.**

- **continue working from anywhere**: All your Rune instances form an e2e-encrypted network of peers, powered by our [headscale](https://github.com/juanfont/headscale) network. Connect to your workstation from your laptop, and to your laptop from your workstation.
- **batteries included**: Production-grade language intelligence, out-of-the-box. Check the list of [supported languages](https://docs.rune.build/languages/supported).
- **a new organizing model**: Stay in the flow for longer. Rune's UI is a screen multiplexer that allows you to organize it freely. Nine workspace slots. Infinite terminals, tabs and windows. A built-in agent or IDE-grade skills for yours.
- **plugins and extensions**: Extend Rune's functionality with [official packages →](https://rune.build/packages) or install community ones straight from a Git repository `pkg install github.com/unstablebuild/rune-extension-themebuilder`.
- **native application**: A native graphics pipeline: OpenGL on Linux, Metal on macOS. No Electron.

## install

On macOS and Linux, this installs the latest release, which keeps itself up to date:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://rune.build/install.sh | sh
```

See the [getting started guide](https://docs.rune.build/) for requirements and your first
steps in Rune.

**Homebrew** (macOS and Linux):

```bash
brew install unstablebuild/tap/rune
```

**Debian and Ubuntu**: download the `.deb` for your architecture from the
[latest release](https://github.com/unstablebuild/rune/releases/latest), then:

```bash
sudo apt install ./rune_*.deb
```

**Arch Linux and Omarchy**: Rune is in the AUR as
[`rune-ide`](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/rune-ide):

```bash
yay -S rune-ide
```

Or, without an AUR helper:

```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/rune-ide.git
cd rune-ide
makepkg -si
```

Packages are updated by your package manager rather than by Rune itself. On other Linux
distributions, use the install command above, or
[build from source](https://docs.rune.build/#other-ways-to-install).

## development

```bash
git clone git@github.com:unstablebuild/rune.git
```

Then run:
```bash
go run ./cmd/rune
```

To create a macOS application bundle:
```bash
make rune-dmg
```

To compile all executables in `./bin`:
```bash
make -j16
```

## headless

Run Rune in headless mode to serve a workspace to all of your development machines,
over the [Rune network](https://docs.rune.build/learn/network):

```bash
docker run -d --name rune \
  --hostname devpod \
  -v /src/projects:/home/rune/projects \
  unstablebuild/rune

$ docker logs -f rune  # prints the sign-in code
```

`--hostname` is the name the node joins the network under, so from any of your machines
`workspaceopen rune://devpod/home/rune/projects` opens the mounted projects.
Language packages install on demand: when a workspace on the node needs one it lacks,
Rune asks you on your machine and installs it on the node.

The [headless guide](https://docs.rune.build/learn/headless) covers running the node as a
service under systemd, launchd, OpenRC, or runit, and adding system tools to the Docker image.
